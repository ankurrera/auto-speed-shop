## Original Refactoring

The original `Account.tsx` file was 1,756 lines and handled multiple responsibilities:
- Authentication (login/signup)
- Profile management
- Address management
- Order history
- Admin dashboard
- Analytics dashboard

After refactoring:
- Main `Account.tsx`: 179 lines (90% reduction)
- Total component lines: ~1,100 lines across focused components
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability
- Easier testing and debugging

## Completed Refactoring

The admin dashboard extraction has been completed successfully. All major account-related functionality has now been properly modularized:
- Authentication (AuthenticationForm)
- Profile management (ProfileContent)
- Address management (AddressesContent)
- Order history (OrdersContent)
- Admin dashboard (AdminDashboardContent)

The refactor transforms unmaintainable monolithic code into a clean, modular architecture while preserving all existing functionality.
