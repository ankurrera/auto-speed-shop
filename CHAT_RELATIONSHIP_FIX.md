# Chat Messages Database Relationship Fix

## Problem
The chat functionality was failing with the error:
```
Error: Failed to fetch conversations: Could not find a relationship between 'chat_messages' and 'profiles' in the schema cache
```

## Root Cause
The `chat_messages` table was created with foreign keys that reference `auth.users(id)` directly:
```sql
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id)
FOREIGN KEY (admin_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id)
```

However, the `chatService.ts` code was trying to use Supabase relationship syntax to join with the `profiles` table:
```typescript
user:profiles!chat_messages_user_id_fkey(
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email
)
```

This relationship didn't exist in the database schema, causing the "Could not find a relationship" error.

## Solution
1. **Migration**: Updated foreign keys to reference `profiles(user_id)` instead of `auth.users(id)`
2. **Database Types**: Added proper relationship definitions to the TypeScript types
3. **Foreign Key Names**: Used naming convention that matches what the chat service expects

## Files Changed
- `supabase/migrations/20250202170000_fix_chat_messages_profiles_relationship.sql` - Migration to fix FK relationships
- `src/database.types.ts` - Added relationships array to chat_messages table definition
- `src/tests/chatMessagesRelationship.test.ts` - Test to validate the fix

## Migration Details
```sql
-- Remove old foreign keys to auth.users
ALTER TABLE chat_messages DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS fk_chat_messages_user_id;
ALTER TABLE chat_messages DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS fk_chat_messages_admin_id;

-- Add new foreign keys to profiles.user_id
ALTER TABLE chat_messages 
ADD CONSTRAINT chat_messages_user_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES profiles(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE chat_messages 
ADD CONSTRAINT chat_messages_admin_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (admin_id) REFERENCES profiles(user_id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

## Expected Result
After applying the migration:
- `AdminCustomerSupportTools.tsx` will be able to fetch all conversations
- `ChatWindow.tsx` will be able to load messages for users
- Real-time chat subscriptions will work correctly
- The relationship queries in `chatService.ts` will resolve successfully

## Testing
Once the migration is applied, test:
1. Open admin panel and check customer support tools
2. As a user, open the chat window
3. Send messages and verify they appear in both user and admin views
4. Verify real-time functionality works
