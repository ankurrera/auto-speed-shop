# User Deletion and Admin Role Assignment Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the user deletion and admin role assignment issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Role Assignment Issue

**Problem**: When signing up with a new admin account, `is_admin` was getting set to TRUE but the `role` field was staying 'user' by default.

**Root Cause**: The `handle_new_user` database trigger always set `role: 'user'` regardless of the `is_admin` value.

**Solution**: 
- Created new migration `20250110120000_fix_admin_role_assignment.sql`
- Added `sync_role_with_is_admin()` trigger function that automatically syncs role with is_admin
- Updated Account.tsx signup logic to explicitly set both `is_admin` and `role` fields
- Added database triggers to maintain consistency between `is_admin` and `role` fields

### 2. User Deletion Issue

**Problem**: When deleting user/admin accounts from Profiles table, the user account remained in Authentication | Users.

**Root Cause**: The `admin_delete_user_profile` function only deleted the profile but left the auth user intact.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced AdminUserManagement.tsx deletion logic to delete both profile and auth user
- Added sequential deletion: first delete profile via RPC, then delete auth user via `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()`
- Improved error handling to show partial success messages when profile deletion succeeds but auth deletion fails

### 3. Admin Dashboard Access

**Status**: Verified working correctly - dashboard access is properly controlled by `is_admin` field.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Changes

1. **New Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20250110120000_fix_admin_role_assignment.sql`
   - Creates `sync_role_with_is_admin()` function
   - Adds triggers for INSERT and UPDATE operations on profiles table
   - Updates existing profiles to sync role with is_admin values

2. **Trigger Logic**:
   ```sql
   IF NEW.is_admin = true THEN
     NEW.role = 'admin';
   ELSIF NEW.is_admin = false THEN
     NEW.role = 'user';
   END IF;
   ```

### Frontend Changes

1. **AdminUserManagement.tsx**:
   - Enhanced `deleteUserMutation` to call both profile and auth deletion
   - Added proper error handling for partial deletions
   - Improved user feedback with detailed success/error messages

2. **Account.tsx**:
   - Updated signup profile update to set both `is_admin` and `role` fields
   - Ensures consistency between the two fields during account creation

## Testing and Verification

### Admin Signup Test

1. Navigate to `/account`
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Select "Admin Signup"
4. Fill out the form and submit
5. Verify that both `is_admin=true` and `role='admin'` are set in the database
6. Verify admin dashboard access after login

### User Deletion Test

1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to admin user management
3. Delete a test user
4. Verify both profile and auth user are removed
5. Attempt to create new account with same email (should work)

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Admin Account Creation**:
   - New admin accounts will have both `is_admin=true` AND `role='admin'`
   - Admin dashboard access will work immediately
   - Role assignment is automatic and consistent

2. **User Deletion**:
   - Deleting a user removes both the profile AND the auth user
   - Deleted email addresses can be used to create new accounts
   - Complete user cleanup prevents orphaned records

3. **Database Consistency**:
   - `role` field automatically syncs with `is_admin` field
   - Database triggers ensure data integrity
   - Existing profiles are updated to maintain consistency

## Files Modified

- `src/components/AdminUserManagement.tsx` - Enhanced user deletion
- `src/pages/Account.tsx` - Fixed admin signup role assignment
- `supabase/migrations/20250110120000_fix_admin_role_assignment.sql` - New database migration

## Minimal Change Approach

All changes follow the minimal modification principle:
- No existing functionality was removed or significantly altered
- Changes are additive and backwards compatible
- Database triggers handle role synchronization automatically
- Frontend changes enhance existing functionality without breaking changes
