# Email Notification Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The email notification service was only logging to console instead of sending actual emails. When a new product/part was listed, users saw console messages like:
```
ðŸ“§ Email notification sent to: ankur@gmail.com
âœ… Email notifications sent to 4 subscribers!
```
But no actual emails were being sent to users.

## Root Cause
The `emailNotificationService.ts` file contained only console.log statements and commented-out email sending code:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (just logging)
console.log(`ðŸ“§ Email notification sent to: ${user.email}`);
// await sendEmail({...}); // This was commented out
```

## Solution
Implemented actual email sending by:

1. **Created API Endpoint**: `src/api/sendNotification.js`
   - Uses nodemailer with Gmail SMTP (same as existing contact.js)
   - Handles validation and error responses
   - Compatible with Vercel deployment

2. **Updated Service**: `src/services/emailNotificationService.ts`
   - Replaced console.log simulation with HTTP requests to API endpoint
   - Added proper error handling
   - Fixed server-side rendering issue with window.location.origin

## Files Changed

### NEW: `src/api/sendNotification.js`
```javascript
// API endpoint for sending emails using nodemailer
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { to, subject, html } = req.body;
  // ... validation and email sending logic
}
```

### UPDATED: `src/services/emailNotificationService.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE: Only console.log
console.log(`ðŸ“§ Email notification sent to: ${user.email}`);

// AFTER: Actual API call
const response = await fetch('/api/sendNotification', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ to: user.email, subject, html: emailContent }),
});
```

## Testing
- âœ… Build successful
- âœ… Linting passes
- âœ… Logic tests demonstrate functionality
- âœ… Demo script shows API calls are made correctly

## Deployment Requirements
For production use, set these environment variables:
- `GMAIL_USER`: Gmail account for sending emails
- `GMAIL_PASSWORD`: Gmail app password or OAuth token

## Result
Users will now receive actual email notifications when new products/parts are listed, instead of just console log messages.
